# My-First-Go-Project
This is my first Go project. Duh.

Beside the basic "Hello World" program, I'm trying to catch up with this course: https://www.alura.com.br/curso-online-golang. This course is all about do a web site monitoring system to see wich one web site is on/off.
Also I'm trying to make my first Go Server. Let's see what I can do.


##Running
In order to run this project you must install Go language here: https://golang.org/doc/install

**1. Clone the repository**

$ git clone https://github.com/macm3/Golang.git

**2. Travell to repository's folder from terminal command line**

**3. Make sure you have Go installed**

$ go version

**4. Building and running your project**
You don't have to build your file. Golang it's beautiful and it can build and run your project at the same time.

$ go run program.go

But you can do it like the old times too.

$ go build program.go

$ go run 

**5. Let's learn and have fun!!!!!!**
